# Temp_Humidity_Sensor
A simple device to monitor temperature and humidity made for my mum's craft room

Based around the brilliant Raspberry Pi Pico this little project is a Xmas present for my mum's crafting room.
Mum likes making cards and so it's important that her crafting room remains low humidity.
The DHT11, though a bit slow, is a perfect low cost sensor to use with this project.
It  uses a DHT11 and an SSD1306 oled display as well as a few LEDs, resistors, wire, protoboard, switch and a small cardboard box.
For a ful list of "stuff" that I used see the equipment_list file.
The code uses 2 libraries (DHT and SSD1306) both of which I disgracefully pinched and used for my own ends via the "Manage Packages" feature within the Thonny IDE. These libraries were written by beings with a far superior intellect to my own and I am very grateful.
If you're wondering where the Do Do room bit in the code comes from, that's what my mum calls her crafting room (bless her)
