List of equipment

Raspberry pi pico (because this is a simple project using minimal GPIO pins any microprocessor using an rp2040 capable of running micropython would work)
DHT 11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
SSD1306 Oled Display (0.96" 128x64)
A simple switch
4 LED's (you choose the colour)
4 resistors (I used 200's but use anything suitable for an LED)
Some wire
A small piece of protoboard
A small cardboard box (I recycled a small one that had components had been posted in and sprayed it red)

For power supply I used a 9V snap connector and battery connected to a cheap DC step down board and then hacked (butchered) an old micro usb cable.
